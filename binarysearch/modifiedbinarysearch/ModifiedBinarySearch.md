# Modified Binary Search

- Whenever we are given a sorted collection, and we are asked to find a certain element, binary search is the **fastest search**!

- Follow [this repository](https://github.com/Chanda-Abdul/Several-Coding-Patterns-for-Solving-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Problems-during-Interviews/blob/main/%E2%9C%85%20%20Pattern%2011%3A%20Modified%20Binary%20Search.md) for the best understanding & perfectly explained answers for sequential questions whose undetstanding is built on top of each other.
