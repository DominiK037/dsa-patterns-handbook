## Context

This repository is my personal collection of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) concepts and common problem-solving patterns, explained in a way that’s useful for interview preparation.

> I hope below context will help me gaining your sympathy (JK). You may see the best resources you can get for the DSA & an Interview Approach OR you may not like SOME or NONE!

It mainly serves as a learning and revision guide for myself, but it can also help you, who's preparing for the technical interviews unlike others who are busy chasing girls.

I have followed multiple resources to get to my current grasp & understanding over the DSA. I have/had no guidance for most of this. Wherever I’ve been inspired or guided by mentor/someone’s content, I’ve mentioned it clearly to keep it FAIR yeah.

## Straight To The Bussiness
 
1. [Best Resources & Sequence](#resources-and-sequence) I would've followed if I were to start from a begining.
2. My step by step [DSA cheatsheet](#dsa-cheatsheet)
3. [Contribution](#contribution) (You can contribute too)

## Resources and Sequence

1. Reality check of an Interview Preparation. [THE BEST TECH INTERVIEW GUIDE SO FAR](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook)

2. Best explanation [Alvin the GOAT](https://structy.net/) of fundamental Data Structures, he will make your fundamentals super strong, trust me with this ONE!

3. Recommended by my mentor [Rishi Prakash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishi-prakash-developer/): [Core DSA Patterns with Step-by-Step LeetCode Problems](https://github.com/Chanda-Abdul/Several-Coding-Patterns-for-Solving-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Problems-during-Interviews/). Honestly, my personal favorite for mastering DSA patterns.

4. [NeetCode 250](https://neetcode.io/practice?tab=neetcode250): A curated set of Leetcode problems with optimal solutions & clear explanations.

## DSA Cheatsheet

**Each Data Structure is explained alongside patterns around each & appropriate Leetcode questions.**

>I found this GOD-LIKE approach in this [GOAT'ED Github Repository](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook). I have also made few good changes which suited my learning style, I'd suggest to have your own opinions on this!

**Branching Model**

* `main` → Always stable and contains verified, reviewed patterns.
* `pattern/` → For adding new **patterns**, **questions**, explanations.
* `docs/` → For updates to documentation (README, pattern markdowns).
* `refactor/` → For restructuring code or renaming folders or optimised logic.
* `chore/` → For minor housekeeping tasks like `.gitignore` or config updates.
