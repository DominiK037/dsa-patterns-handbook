# Context

A curated collection of Data Structures & Algorithms patterns implemented in Java and documented with step-by-step explanations.  

This repository mainly serves as a personal learning & revising resource.

> Important!
- You can use this repository to understand the patterns to solve DSA questions.

## Goals
To be smooth in pattern recognition and algorithmic reasoning rather than memorization.  

Every problem included here focuses on:
- Identifying the underlying pattern.
- Explaining the reasoning path.
- Writing clean, optimized code.
- Time & Space complexities.

## Git Guidelines

This repository follows simplified, professional Git conventions optimized for an educational codebase where clarity, topic organization, and clean history matter more than complex release flows.

### Branching Model branch ·õ¶

We use a lightweight trunk-based model with short-lived feature branches.

* `main` ‚Üí Always stable and contains verified, reviewed patterns.
* `pattern/` ‚Üí For adding new **patterns**, **questions**, explanations.
* `docs/` ‚Üí For updates to documentation (README, pattern markdowns).
* `refactor/` ‚Üí For restructuring code or renaming folders or optimised logic.
* `chore/` ‚Üí For minor housekeeping tasks like `.gitignore` or config updates.
* `experiment/` ‚Üí For testing alternate solutions or approaches temporarily.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Branches should be short-lived and merged quickly to keep history linear and clean.


### Branch Naming Rules

* Use lowercase, hyphen-separated words.
* Prefix branch with its purpose (`pattern/`, `docs/`, etc.).
* Optionally include topic name or DSA concept.

Examples:
- `feature/arrays-sliding-window`
- `feature/dp-knapsack`
- `docs/update-readme`
- `refactor/rename-dp-folder`
- `chore/setup-gitignore`


### Commit Message Conventions

We follow the Conventional Commits format, simplified for algorithmic documentation.

Structure:

`<type>(<scope?>): <short description>`
`<optional details/explanation>`

## Pattern Template

Use this template when documenting new patterns or problems.

````markdown
[Pattern]: pattern name

- When to recognize: signals/shape of input

- Brute force baseline: O(‚Ä¶) & why it‚Äôs too slow

- Core idea: one key invariant/insight

- Algorithm (steps): step by step explanation
  
- Complexity: Time O(?), Space O(?) + add line by line explanation for both.  
- Edge cases: list of edge cases  
- Variants: when this pattern breaks / common twists  
- Code (Java): short, clean implementation  

- Thoughts: Your relevant thoughts around this specific pattern/question
